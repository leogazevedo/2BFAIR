# 2BFAIR

This site was created to present some information about the 2BFAIR framework and to include the links of the current implementation. 2BFAIR has frontend and backend. The frontend was implemented using Angular and the backend was implemented in Python and exposed as a RESTful API.

The file [2BFAIR-user-guide](https://github.com/leogazevedo/2BFAIR/blob/main/2BFAIR-user-guide.pdf) presents how to use the user interface of 2BFAIR.

The 2BFAIR framework, backend, and frontend are available at [github.com/IBM/2BFAIR-framework](https://github.com/IBM/2BFAIR-framework).
