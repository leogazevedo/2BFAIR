# 2BFAIR

This site was created to present some information about the 2BFAIR framework and to include the links of the current implementation which includes code for the frontend and backend. The frontend was implemented using Angular and the backend was implemented in Python as a RESTful API.

The frontend and backend codes are in a process for approval to become open-source by IBM which was not concluded before the 2BFAIR paper submission.
